# Shotgun 

A bad-ass backbone application loader.

## Requirements

Shotgun's git repo is available on GitHub, which can be browsed at:

    <http://github.com/activecell/shotgun>

and cloned with:

    git clone git://github.com/activecell/shotgun.git

Check your system for local requirements (run until it passes!):

    script/bootstrap

Run tests to ensure that all pass:

    npm test
    
Run the project locally:

    npm start

Then navigate to the [showcase](http://localhost:5000).
